Theory Thursdays (Monsoon '24)
==============================

We meet every Thursday evening to discuss and share what we've learnt/found interesting, and also to just hang out. There are no restrictions on what should be discussed, as long as it is related to theory. These usually tend to extend into the next morning!

Volunteers come prepared to teach topics of their choice to kick-off the discussion, an activity affectionately dubbed "Theory Thurdsay Teaching". 

Below are the topics we have covered this semester along with the slides for the presentations.

1. [Philosophy 101](../Assets/2024_monsoon/philo101.md) by [Chinmay Sharma](ubermayinch.github.io)
2. [Sprague-Grundy Theorem and Game of Nim](../Assets/2024_monsoon/Presentation.pdf) by Sohan Thumalla
3. How to Read a Research Paper by Shirley
4. Visual Group Theory by Niranjan
