[Theory Research Discussions](/Initiatives/Research)
----------------

**May 2021 - July 2021**

Students meet up every week to discuss and share their current research ideas and work with the rest of the group. Everyone is free to join and learn more about the work that goes on in our lab. This is a purely student-run initiative, to bring the theory research community closer

[Seminar Saturdays](/Initiatives/Seminar-Saturdays)
-----------------

**August 2020 - May 2021**

An initiative to have regular presentations on various topics, delivered by different students. The primary goal is to learn or be aware different topics and fields, at least at a surface level.

If you want to present a topic, please let us know in the `#seminar-saturdays`. We'll try to schedule as many talks as possible (but only one in a week).
The talk must be 30-60 minutes long, and the presenter can take questions after it is done. Please stick to a rigid time plan for the talk, to prevent it from becoming too long.
Post the title + abstract and resources for the talk 3 days in advance (on the previous Wednesday), and mention the prerequisites.

Problem of the Week (PotW)
--------------------------

**August 2020 - April 2021**

Problem solving is a nice way for people to discuss and learn theory. This initiative is to have regular problem solving, and encouraging everyone to discuss after they've attempted the solution.

A problem will be posted in `#problem-of-the-week` on Saturday every week. And you'll be free to discuss it in the chat in `#potw-discussions` the Friday after it's posted. Everyone is also free to discuss older problems there (in case they didn't have time in a week to attempt it etc.)

Note that the aim isn't to take a very difficult problem and solve it. It might be a very simple problem, but having an elegant solution, or emphasizing on a particular concept in a unique, interesting way.
