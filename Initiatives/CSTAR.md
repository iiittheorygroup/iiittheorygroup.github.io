CSTAR Discussions
=================

Hello folks, we have a discussion group for the _Center for Security, Theory and Algorithms Research_. Lab students meet up every week to discuss and share their current research ideas and work with the rest of the group. Everyone is free to join and learn more about the work that goes on in our lab. This is a purely student-run initiative, to bring the CSTAR research community closer.

Who does this benefit?
-----------------

For existing CSTAR students:
- Helps get a better idea of other research projects in the group.
- More opportunities for idea sharing and collaboration.
- Brings our research group closer as a community.

For students who plan to join/have just joined CSTAR:
- Gives a nice overview of different projects and topics of interest.
- Introduces you to the other researchers in the group, making it easier to approach them.
- Can give a smoother transition into research, saving you time from doing a lot of searching yourself.

For students of other labs:
- Paints a picture of what CSTAR folks are doing.
- Opens up more avenues for cross-discipline collaboration.
- Could be a fun thing to learn other random research topics.

For new students/non-research folks:
- An exposition into our world of research.
- Chances for potential opportunities, if you want to try this out.
- A chance for us to share our ideas and work with more people who are curious and interested.

The Plan
--------

**Weekly lab meetings - Saturdays 3 PM - 4 PM IST**  
TODO: Add link to calendar entry

Students meet up every week to discuss their work, recent updates, new opportunities, collaboration offers etc.

During the 1 hour session, to keep discussions productive, we will stick to our level of abstraction. This might make it harder for non-CSTAR students to follow. To cover that, people are free to hangout after the official session closes, to chat with the others - either one on one, or in the group chat. The lab students will be more than happy to explain details of their work, or basics leading up to it.

(Will be updated once campus opens up to account for in-person meets)
