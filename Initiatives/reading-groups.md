Reading groups
=================

People interested in learning a particular topic form a reading group. A channel is created on the server dedicated to the reading group to have discussions (ask questions, discuss exercises, etc) and members also meet regularly. Although this is how a reading group is generally structured, there are no hard and fast rules on running a reading group. Members of the reading group have complete freedom to run the reading group as they see fit. The point of running it on the server is to provide a platform of students interested in theory topics who may contribute to the reading group.

Below are reading groups that were run in the past:
